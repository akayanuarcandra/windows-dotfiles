# aru's Windows Dotfiles
this is my personal dotfiles for windows customisation, some things are broken because, well, windows, and my workstation isn't actually that strong enough to handle many things. also my [linux](https://github.com/akayanuarcandra/windows-dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file#linux) dotfiles finally ready! go check it out!

Also these configs are incredibly messy since i don't have much time to clean up unused things
